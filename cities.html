<!--Question 1: During this linear process, where Dev B changed the document after Dev A had already committed and pushed their change to the remote (github), what extra step(s) could Developer B have taken to completely avoid this merge conflict?

We thought as a rule of thumb developers should check to see if the remote/local repositories are identical. 
If they are not then the developer should be the most recent copy from the server and then add in their changes and finally commit/ push his/her work. Also you have to make sure you communicate changes ahead of time. 


Question 2: Given your answer in Q1, does this mean that merge conflicts can be completely (always) avoided in the real world? Why or why not?

In the best case yes these things can be avoided but due to human error there are no guarantees...
